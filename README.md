# GetForm
Created with CodeSandbox

This is a simple app I've made as a first practice using MongoDB in a Node.Js and Express.Js server.

GetForm has just a simple html page with a form, when the user submits te inputs all the data that is provided it's stored in MongoDB Atlas.
I'll keep adding things to this proyect to practice more CRUD operations with MongoDB.
